# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Slack to Teams Migration Tool

## 1. Product Overview
The Slack to Teams Migration Tool is a PowerShell-based automation solution designed to migrate Slack workspace data (channels, messages, personal chats, and files) to Microsoft Teams. It parses Slack JSON export files, utilizes the Microsoft Graph API for Teams operations, and optionally leverages the Slack API for downloading missing files. This tool ensures seamless platform transitions while maintaining data integrity and user continuity.

### Problem Statement
Organizations migrating from Slack to Teams encounter challenges in transferring historical data, including threaded conversations, file attachments, and user mappings. Existing tools often require third-party services or complex setups, leading to time-consuming and error-prone manual processes. This results in disconnected workflows and potential data loss, impacting productivity and knowledge continuity.

### Proposed Solution
A comprehensive PowerShell script suite that:
- Parses Slack export JSON structures
- Maps Slack entities to Teams equivalents using CSV configurations
- Creates Teams channels and posts messages via Microsoft Graph API
- Downloads and uploads file attachments
- Handles rate limiting, error recovery, and logging
- Supports dry-run mode for validation

## 2. Objectives
### Business Objectives
- Complete migration of 100% of accessible Slack data within the specified timeframe
- Achieve 99.9% data integrity (no message loss, correct user mappings)
- Reduce migration time by 80% compared to manual processes

### User Success Metrics
- Zero disruption to ongoing Teams usage during migration
- All historical conversations accessible in Teams within 24 hours of migration completion
- File attachments properly linked and downloadable

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Migration Success Rate: 99% of channels/messages successfully migrated
- Error Rate: Less than 1% of operations fail requiring manual intervention
- Processing Speed: 1000 messages/minute average throughput
- Notification Delivery: 100% of critical alerts sent successfully
- Recovery Rate: 95% of failed operations recoverable via retry mechanisms

## 3. Target Users
### Primary User Segment: IT Administrators
IT admins in enterprise environments responsible for workspace migrations. They require reliable data transfer, audit trails, and minimal disruption to end users. Goals include completing migrations within maintenance windows while ensuring compliance and data security.

### Secondary User Segment: Migration Specialists
Consultants or internal teams specializing in platform migrations. They need flexible scripting capabilities and detailed logging for troubleshooting complex scenarios.

## 4. Features and Requirements
### Core Features (MVP Scope)
- **JSON Export Parsing:** Parse Slack export structure to extract channels, users, and messages
- **User Mapping:** Apply CSV-based user mappings for Slack-to-Teams identity translation
- **Channel Creation:** Create Teams channels matching Slack channel structure
- **Message Migration:** Post messages to Teams with proper timestamps and threading
- **File Handling:** Download and upload file attachments using APIs
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging and retry mechanisms
- **Configuration Management:** JSON-based settings with environment variable overrides
- **Email Notifications:** Send alerts on phase completion, errors, or critical events
- **Execution Modes:** Support for Auto, ConfirmOnError, and ConfirmEachPhase modes
- **Targeted Migration:** Ability to migrate single channels or specific users
- **Delta Sync:** Incremental updates for changed data or partial migrations
- **Phase Skipping:** Option to skip completed phases in subsequent runs
- **API Resilience:** Graceful handling when Slack API is unavailable

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Real-time migration (batch processing only)
- Advanced formatting conversion (basic text/markdown only)
- Integration with third-party tools
- GUI interface (command-line only)
- Multi-platform migration support (Discord, Mattermost)
- AI-powered content analysis

## 5. User Stories
### As an IT Administrator
- I want to migrate all Slack data to Teams reliably so that I can ensure data continuity and compliance.
- I want the migration to complete within maintenance windows so that there is minimal disruption to users.
- I want detailed audit trails so that I can verify the migration's success and troubleshoot issues.

### As a Migration Specialist
- I want flexible scripting capabilities so that I can handle complex mapping scenarios.
- I want detailed logging so that I can troubleshoot and resolve issues efficiently.
- I want support for dry-run mode so that I can validate the migration before execution.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- Successful migration of a test workspace with 10+ channels, 1000+ messages, and 100+ files
- Achieve 99% data accuracy
- Complete migration within 1 hour
- Migration Success Rate: 99%
- Error Rate: <1%
- Processing Speed: 1000 messages/minute

## 7. Technical Requirements
### Platform Requirements
- Target Platforms: Windows PowerShell 5.1+, PowerShell Core 7+
- Performance: Handle 10k+ messages/hour, 1GB+ file transfers

### Technology Stack
- Backend: PowerShell scripting
- Integrations: Microsoft Graph API, Slack Web API
- Security: Secure token storage, HTTPS-only communications

### Architecture
- Modular scripts in phases: parse, map, provision, migrate
- Sequential phase execution with shared configuration
- Repository Structure: Phases/, Shared/, Config/, etc.

## 8. Implementation Details
### Phases
1. Parse Slack export files
2. Map users and channels
3. Provision Teams channels
4. Post messages
5. Download files
6. Upload files
7. Verify migration
8. Retry and fixups
9. Archive run

### Constraints
- Budget: No external tool licenses (PowerShell-only)
- Timeline: MVP delivery within 4 weeks
- Resources: Single developer, test environments

### Assumptions
- Valid Slack export files available
- Teams admin access via Graph API
- Slack API tokens with necessary permissions
- Network connectivity during migration
- Pre-configured CSV mappings

## 9. Risks and Mitigation
### Key Risks
- API Rate Limiting: Implement retry mechanisms and batch processing
- Data Volume: Optimize memory usage and processing
- Authentication Failures: Secure token management and monitoring
- User Mapping Errors: Validation steps and audit logs

### Open Questions
- Handling deleted users in Slack exports
- Maximum supported message/file sizes
- Preserving message threading in Teams
- Private channels/DMs handling
- Optimal batch sizes for API rate limiting
- Token refresh mechanisms for long-running migrations

## 10. Timeline and Milestones
- Week 1: Setup development environment, initial module structure
- Week 2: Implement JSON parsing and user/channel mapping
- Week 3: Develop message posting and file handling
- Week 4: Testing, error handling, and validation

## 11. Success Criteria
- MVP: Successful test migration with specified metrics
- Post-MVP: Real-time sync, advanced formatting, bulk provisioning
