# Project Brief: Slack to Teams Migration Tool

## Executive Summary
A PowerShell-based automation tool that migrates Slack workspace data (channels, messages, personal chats, and files) to Microsoft Teams. The solution parses Slack JSON export files, uses Microsoft Graph API for Teams operations, and optionally leverages Slack API for downloading missing files. This addresses the need for seamless platform transitions while maintaining data integrity and user continuity.

## Problem Statement
Organizations migrating from Slack to Microsoft Teams face challenges in transferring historical data, including threaded conversations, file attachments, and user mappings. Existing migration tools often require third-party services or complex setups, while manual processes are time-consuming and error-prone. The current state involves disconnected workflows and potential data loss during transitions. This problem impacts productivity and knowledge continuity, with existing solutions falling short in PowerShell-native approaches and API-only file handling.

## Proposed Solution
A comprehensive PowerShell script suite that:
- Parses Slack export JSON structure (channels.json, users.json, message files)
- Maps Slack entities to Teams equivalents using CSV configuration files
- Creates Teams channels and posts messages via Microsoft Graph API
- Downloads missing files via Slack API with proper authentication
- Handles rate limiting, error recovery, and progress logging
- Supports dry-run mode for validation

This solution succeeds where others fail by being entirely PowerShell-based, requiring no external dependencies beyond standard modules, and providing granular control over the migration process.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: IT Administrators
IT admins responsible for workspace migrations in enterprise environments. They manage user accounts, security policies, and integration setups. Their primary needs include reliable data transfer, audit trails, and minimal disruption to end users. Goals: Complete migrations within maintenance windows while ensuring compliance and data security.

### Secondary User Segment: Migration Specialists
Consultants or internal teams specializing in platform migrations. They handle complex mapping scenarios and custom integrations. Needs: Flexible scripting capabilities and detailed logging for troubleshooting.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Complete migration of 100% of accessible Slack data within specified timeframe
- Achieve 99.9% data integrity (no message loss, correct user mappings)
- Reduce migration time by 80% compared to manual processes

### User Success Metrics
- Zero disruption to ongoing Teams usage during migration
- All historical conversations accessible in Teams within 24 hours of migration completion
- File attachments properly linked and downloadable

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Migration Success Rate: 99% of channels/messages successfully migrated
- Error Rate: Less than 1% of operations fail requiring manual intervention
- Processing Speed: 1000 messages/minute average throughput
- Notification Delivery: 100% of critical alerts sent successfully
- Recovery Rate: 95% of failed operations recoverable via retry mechanisms

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **JSON Export Parsing:** Parse Slack export structure and extract channels, users, messages
- **User Mapping:** Apply CSV-based user mappings for Slack-to-Teams identity translation
- **Channel Creation:** Create Teams channels matching Slack channel structure
- **Message Migration:** Post messages to Teams with proper timestamps and threading
- **File Handling:** Download and upload file attachments using APIs
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive logging and retry mechanisms
- **Configuration Management:** JSON-based settings with environment variable overrides
- **Email Notifications:** Send alerts on phase completion, errors, or critical events
- **Execution Modes:** Support for Auto, ConfirmOnError, and ConfirmEachPhase modes
- **Targeted Migration:** Ability to migrate single channels or specific users
- **Delta Sync:** Incremental updates for changed data or partial migrations
- **Phase Skipping:** Option to skip completed phases in subsequent runs
- **API Resilience:** Graceful handling when Slack API is unavailable

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Real-time migration (only batch processing)
- Advanced formatting conversion (basic text/markdown only)
- Integration with third-party tools
- GUI interface (command-line only)
- Multi-platform migration support (Discord, Mattermost)
- AI-powered content analysis and tagging

### MVP Success Criteria
Successful migration of test workspace with 10+ channels, 1000+ messages, and 100+ files, achieving 99% data accuracy and completing within 1 hour.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- Real-time sync capabilities
- Advanced message formatting (rich text, mentions, reactions)
- Bulk user provisioning
- Migration scheduling and monitoring dashboard
- Enhanced notifications and alerting system
- Advanced execution controls (targeted runs, delta syncs)
- API resilience and failover mechanisms

### Long-term Vision
- Multi-platform migration support (Discord, Mattermost)
- Enterprise compliance features (data retention, audit logs)
- AI-powered content analysis and tagging
- SaaS offering for managed migrations
- Integration marketplace for custom mappings
- Analytics dashboard for migration insights

### Expansion Opportunities
- SaaS offering for managed migrations
- Integration marketplace for custom mappings
- Analytics dashboard for migration insights

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Windows PowerShell 5.1+, PowerShell Core 7+
- **Browser/OS Support:** Windows (primary), cross-platform for Core
- **Performance Requirements:** Handle 10k+ messages/hour, 1GB+ file transfers

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** N/A (CLI tool)
- **Backend:** PowerShell scripting
- **Database:** N/A (file-based processing)
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Local execution or Azure Automation

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Modular scripts in phases (parse, map, provision, migrate)
- **Service Architecture:** Sequential phase execution with shared configuration
- **Integration Requirements:** Microsoft Graph API, Slack Web API
- **Security/Compliance:** Secure token storage, HTTPS-only communications

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** No external tool licenses (PowerShell-only)
- **Timeline:** MVP delivery within 4 weeks
- **Resources:** Single developer, access to test environments
- **Technical:** API rate limits, authentication requirements

### Key Assumptions
- Valid Slack export files are available
- Teams admin access via Graph API
- Slack API tokens have necessary permissions
- Network connectivity during migration
- CSV mappings are pre-configured accurately

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **API Rate Limiting:** Graph API throttling could slow migration significantly
- **Data Volume:** Large exports may exceed memory limits
- **Authentication Failures:** Token expiration or permission changes during migration
- **User Mapping Errors:** Incorrect mappings could misattribute messages

### Open Questions
- How to handle deleted users in Slack exports?
- What is the maximum supported message/file size?
- How to preserve message threading in Teams?
- What happens with private channels/DMs?
- Optimal batch sizes for API rate limiting?
- Token refresh mechanisms for long-running migrations?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Microsoft Teams API limitations for bulk operations
- Slack export file size limits and compression
- Optimal batch sizes for API calls
- Error recovery strategies for partial failures
