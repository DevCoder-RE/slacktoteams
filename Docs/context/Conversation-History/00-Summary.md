# 🧠 Slack to Teams Migration — Conversation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the full design and development conversation between Karl and Copilot, which led to the creation of a flexible, enterprise-grade Slack-to-Teams migration solution. The goal was to build a tool that could operate offline using Slack's full export, while optionally leveraging the Slack API for file retrieval. The solution was designed to be modular, resilient, and configurable — suitable for personal use but with the potential to scale for broader adoption.

## 🧭 Origin & Intent

Karl needed to migrate his Slack workspace to Microsoft Teams. The initial requirement was to build a solution that could:
- Operate offline using Slack's full export
- Retrieve files via Slack API when needed
- Preserve Slack structure as closely as possible
- Be robust enough to serve others if it proved viable

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

We chose a modular pipeline architecture with eight distinct phases:
1. **Discovery** — Identify channels and users
2. **Parse** — Normalize Slack messages
3. **Map Users** — Resolve Slack users to Microsoft 365 identities
4. **Provision Teams** — Create Teams and channels
5. **Post Messages** — Send messages to Teams
6. **Download Files** — Retrieve Slack files (live or offline)
7. **Upload Files** — Upload files to Teams
8. **Validate & Report** — Confirm migration success

Each phase is implemented as a standalone PowerShell script, allowing for flexible execution, retries, and preflight testing.

## 🔄 Execution Modes

The solution supports two modes:
- **Offline Mode** — Uses Slack export files only
- **Live Mode** — Uses Slack and Microsoft Graph APIs

Execution mode is controlled via `appsettings.json` or CLI flags. Most features are optional and have sensible defaults, making the tool adaptable to different environments and use cases.

## 🔧 Configuration & Extensibility

- Configurable via `.env` and `appsettings.json`
- Supports user/channel mapping files
- Includes emoji translation and message filtering
- Designed for preflight simulation, interactive runs, or automated pipelines

---

## 🧪 Resilience & Validation

- Slack API throttling handled with retries and exponential backoff
- Graph API errors logged and retried where safe
- Validation phase compares parsed vs posted content
- Summary reports and logs generated for each run

---

## 🔮 Future Potential

Karl expressed interest in evolving the tool into a broader solution. Ideas include:
- GUI wrapper for non-technical users
- Support for attachments, reactions, and threads
- Integration with Teams Migration API (import mode)
- Packaging as a PowerShell module or CLI tool

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Notes

- The orchestrator script underwent the most refactoring
- Decisions were made collaboratively, with tradeoffs discussed
- The solution balances robustness with simplicity, aiming for clarity and maintainability
