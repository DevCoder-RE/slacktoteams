# 🎯 Initial Goals & Constraints

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Karl needed to migrate content from Slack to Microsoft Teams. The challenge was that Slack and Teams have fundamentally different architectures, APIs, and data models. Existing tools were either too limited, required cloud access, or didn’t preserve message fidelity. Karl wanted a solution that could:

- Work offline using Slack’s full export
- Optionally use Slack’s API for file retrieval
- Preserve message formatting, timestamps, and authorship
- Be modular and scriptable for future reuse

---

## 🛠️ Constraints

The solution had to meet several constraints:

- **No external dependencies** beyond PowerShell and standard CLI tools
- **Offline-first** design, with optional online enhancements
- **Minimal assumptions** about the target Teams environment
- **Configurable** via simple JSON and ENV files
- **Transparent logging** and error handling
- **Scalable** for multiple channels and users

---

## 🧪 Early Experiments

Initial tests focused on:

- Parsing Slack export JSON files
- Mapping Slack users to Microsoft 365 identities
- Posting messages to Teams via Graph API
- Handling emojis, attachments, and timestamps

These experiments revealed key gaps in existing tools and helped shape the modular pipeline approach.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Karl emphasized clarity, control, and resilience. The solution was built to:

- Be understandable by other engineers
- Allow partial runs and retries
- Support preflight validation
- Log everything for audit and debugging

The goal wasn’t just to migrate data — it was to build a tool that could be trusted, reused, and extended.

## 🔮 Vision

While the initial goal was personal migration, Karl envisioned broader use cases:

- Helping small teams migrate without IT support
- Creating a GUI wrapper for non-technical users
- Packaging the scripts into a CLI tool or PowerShell module
- Supporting Slack threads, reactions, and attachments

This vision guided decisions throughout the design process.
