# Project Iterations Log

This document captures key changes and iterations in the direction of the project. Each entry includes the date/time, context, and summary of changes.

## Iteration 1: Documentation Alignment and Enhancement Planning

**Date/Time:** September 11, 2025, 12:00 UTC  
**Context:** Following comprehensive review of development history, architecture, and original idea, key insights revealed the need to align documentation with the current implementation status and incorporate suggested enhancements for production readiness. The review identified that all 7 core migration phases are implemented with robust error handling, and additional features like notifications and execution modes are needed for enterprise deployment.

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Documentation Review:** Conducted thorough review of HISTORY.md (development conversations), ARCHITECTURE.md (folder structure and quick start), and idea.md (original concept and problem statement) to understand current implementation state.
- **PRD Update:** Expanded prd.md to reflect the implemented 9-phase structure (adding Phase 8: Retry and Fixups, Phase 9: Archive Run) and incorporated suggested enhancements including email notifications, execution modes (Auto, ConfirmOnError, ConfirmEachPhase), targeted migration support, delta sync capabilities, phase skipping, and API resilience features.
- **Project Brief Update:** Updated project-brief.md to align MVP scope with implemented features, moved advanced capabilities to Phase 2 and long-term vision, and added new KPIs for notification delivery and recovery rates.
- **Feature Adjustments:** Moved multi-platform support and AI-powered features to post-MVP to maintain focus on core Slack-to-Teams migration functionality.
- **Constraints Update:** Added open questions around API rate limiting, token refresh mechanisms, and optimal batch sizes for large-scale migrations.
- **Budget/Impact Assessment:** No budget changes required as enhancements are PowerShell-based; impact focuses on improved reliability and user experience for enterprise migrations.

**Impact:** These changes ensure documentation accurately reflects the robust, production-ready state of the migration tool while positioning it for enterprise adoption through enhanced reliability and operational features. The updated scope maintains the core value proposition of seamless Slack-to-Teams migration while addressing operational needs identified in the development history.

## Iteration 2: Advanced Features Implementation

**Date/Time:** September 11, 2025, 13:00 UTC
**Context:** Following the successful implementation of core migration functionality and enhanced documentation, focus shifted to implementing high-priority advanced features requested by enterprise users. The development prioritized rollback capabilities, real-time sync, and parallel processing to address key operational needs for production deployments.

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Rollback System (Phase 10):** Implemented comprehensive rollback capabilities with full and selective rollback modes, automatic backup creation, and point-in-time recovery options. Includes Teams data backup before rollback operations and detailed rollback summaries.
- **Real-Time Sync (Phase 11):** Added continuous synchronization capabilities for ongoing Slack-to-Teams migration after initial batch completion. Supports configurable sync intervals, runtime limits, and state tracking to prevent duplicate processing.
- **Parallel Processing:** Implemented parallel processing framework with configurable concurrency limits for channels and files. Added PowerShell 7+ parallel processing support with fallback to sequential processing for older versions.
- **Enhanced Orchestration:** Updated Run-All.ps1 to support rollback and real-time sync modes with dedicated parameter sets and execution paths.
- **Shared Modules:** Added Shared-Parallel.ps1 module with utilities for concurrent processing, channel batching, and resource management.
- **Documentation Updates:** Updated README.md, API_REFERENCE.md, and user guides to document new features, parameters, and usage scenarios.

**Impact:** These advanced features significantly enhance the tool's enterprise readiness by providing operational flexibility, disaster recovery options, and improved performance for large-scale migrations. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities for production use cases.
