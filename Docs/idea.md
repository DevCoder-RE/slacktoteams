I have an export file from slack and want to use it to migrate the channels, chats, personal messages and files to teams. Is there a way to do this only using pwershell? I only want to use the slack api to get access to the files that we have not been able to download. Can you give me the best options to accomplish task. Ask me questions until you are 95% sure that you can perform the task, and if you do not have evidence to provide an answer say that you dont have an answer.
