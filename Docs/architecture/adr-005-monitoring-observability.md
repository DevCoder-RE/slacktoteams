# ADR 005: Monitoring and Observability Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Slack to Teams migration tool requires enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities to track progress, performance, and issues in real-time. This ensures reliability, provides visibility into long-running operations, and enables proactive issue resolution.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive monitoring system with the following components:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Centralized metrics tracking for API calls, processing times, success rates, errors, and warnings.
2. **Real-Time Dashboard**: PowerShell-based console dashboard displaying live progress, ETA, and key metrics.
3. **Integration with Monitoring Tools**: Support for webhook notifications and Azure Monitor metric ingestion.

## Implementation Details

### Shared-Monitoring.ps1
- Global `$Global:Metrics` hashtable for storing all metrics
- Functions for initializing monitoring, updating phase progress, recording API calls, errors, and warnings
- Metrics summary generation
- Webhook notification support
- Azure Monitor integration (placeholder for actual API implementation)

### Dashboard.ps1
- Real-time display of migration progress
- Refreshable console interface
- Shows overall progress, API calls, issues, phase details, success rates, and ETA

### Integration Points
- Run-All.ps1 loads Shared-Monitoring.ps1 and initializes monitoring
- Invoke-Phase function updated to track phase progress and record errors
- Notifications sent via email and webhooks
- Metrics sent to Azure Monitor on completion

### Configuration
- Added "Monitoring" section to appsettings.json with WebhookUrl and AzureMonitor settings

## Consequences

### Positive
- Real-time visibility into migration progress
- Comprehensive metrics for performance analysis
- Integration with enterprise monitoring tools
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Negative
- Slight performance overhead from metrics collection
- Additional configuration required for integrations

## Alternatives Considered
- External monitoring tools only: Rejected due to need for integrated, real-time dashboard
- Database-backed metrics: Overkill for this use case, file-based sufficient

## Compliance
- Enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities
- Maintains backward compatibility
