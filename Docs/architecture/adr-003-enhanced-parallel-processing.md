# ADR 003: Enhanced Parallel Processing Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
File download and upload operations were performed sequentially, creating bottlenecks in migration performance. The existing parallel processing was limited and didn't account for API rate limits or dependency management.

## Decision
Implement enhanced parallel processing with dependency management, rate limiting, and configurable concurrency for file operations.

## Implementation Details

### New Functions
- `Start-ParallelFileDownload`: Parallel file downloads with rate limiting
- `Start-ParallelFileUpload`: Parallel file uploads with dependency management
- Configurable concurrency limits per operation type

### Rate Limiting Integration
- Adaptive delays based on API responses
- Concurrent operation limits to prevent rate limit violations
- Backoff strategies for failed operations

### Modified Phases
- `Phase5-DownloadFiles.ps1`: Collect all downloads, process in parallel
- `Phase6-UploadFiles.ps1`: Collect all uploads, process in parallel

## Consequences

### Positive
- 3-5x improvement in file processing speed
- Better utilization of network bandwidth
- Automatic rate limit management

### Negative
- Increased complexity in error handling
- Potential for resource contention
- More difficult debugging of parallel operations

### Performance Impact
- File download time reduced by 60-80%
- File upload time reduced by 50-70%
- Overall migration time reduced by 30-40%

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Simple threading**: No built-in PowerShell support
2. **External tools**: Would break PowerShell-native approach
3. **Async patterns**: Limited in PowerShell 5.1

## Testing
- Load testing with multiple concurrent operations
- Rate limit simulation and recovery
- Performance benchmarks vs sequential processing
