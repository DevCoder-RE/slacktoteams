# Slack to Teams Migration Tool - System Architecture

## 1. System Overview and Context

The Slack to Teams Migration Tool is a comprehensive PowerShell-based automation solution designed to migrate Slack workspace data to Microsoft Teams. The system processes Slack export files and utilizes Microsoft Graph API to recreate channels, messages, users, and file attachments in Teams, ensuring data integrity and continuity during platform transitions.

### Business Context
Organizations migrating from Slack to Teams require reliable, automated data transfer to maintain historical conversations, file attachments, and user mappings. This tool addresses the gap left by manual processes and third-party services by providing a secure, customizable PowerShell solution.

### System Scope
- **In Scope**: Channel migration, message posting, user mapping, file transfers, configuration management
- **Out of Scope**: Real-time synchronization (planned for future), GUI interface, multi-platform support

## 2. Architecture Principles and Constraints

### Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Each migration phase is a standalone PowerShell script for flexibility and testability
- **Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and rollback capabilities
- **Security**: Secure credential management, HTTPS-only communications, no persistent secrets
- **Observability**: Structured logging, progress tracking, and detailed reporting
- **Configurability**: JSON-based configuration with environment variable overrides

### Technical Constraints
- **Platform**: Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 7+
- **Dependencies**: Microsoft Graph API, optional Slack Web API
- **Execution Model**: Sequential phase execution with optional parallel processing
- **Data Volume**: Designed for workspaces up to 10k+ messages, 1GB+ file transfers

### Data Structures

#### Slack Export Format
- **users.json**: User metadata (ID, name, email, profile)
- **channels.json**: Channel definitions (ID, name, type, members)
- **Channel directories**: Date-stamped JSON files containing message arrays
- **File attachments**: Referenced by URL or included in export

#### Internal Data Models
- **ParsedMessage**: Normalized message with user mapping, timestamp, content
- **MigrationInventory**: Complete workspace inventory with relationships
- **PhaseOutput**: Structured JSON outputs from each phase
- **ValidationReport**: Success/failure metrics and error details

#### Configuration Data
- **appsettings.json**: Main configuration with API credentials
- **.env**: Environment variable overrides for secrets
- **mappings/users.csv**: Slack-to-Teams user mapping
- **mappings/channels.csv**: Channel name transformations
- **message-filters.json**: Content filtering rules

## 5. API Integration Patterns

### Microsoft Graph API Integration
- **Authentication**: Client credentials flow with token caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Exponential backoff with configurable delays
- **Error Handling**: HTTP status code analysis and retry logic
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - Teams creation and management
  - Channel provisioning
  - Message posting with HTML content
  - File upload to SharePoint/OneDrive
  - User lookup and member management

### Slack API Integration
- **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication
- **Usage**: Primarily for file downloads when export URLs are insufficient
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to offline mode
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - files.info for metadata
  - Direct file download URLs

### Integration Patterns
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable attempts with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker**: Not implemented (future enhancement)
- **Idempotency**: Phase-based execution prevents duplicate operations
- **Monitoring**: All API calls logged with timing and success metrics

## 6. Deployment and Operational Architecture

### Deployment Model
- **Packaging**: Directory-based deployment, no installation required
- **Prerequisites**: PowerShell 5.1+, network access to APIs
- **Configuration**: Copy sample configs, customize for environment
- **Execution**: Run bootstrap scripts or individual phases

### Operational Modes
- **Offline Mode**: Uses only Slack export files
- **Live Mode**: Leverages both export and APIs for enhanced fidelity
- **Dry Run**: Validation mode without actual Teams modifications
- **Delta Mode**: Incremental updates for partial migrations

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Logging**: Structured logs with timestamps, levels, and context
- **Progress Tracking**: Phase completion status and metrics
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages with remediation guidance
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, API call counts, success rates

### Backup and Recovery
- **Rollback Phase**: Automated reversal of Teams changes
- **Archive Phase**: Complete migration artifacts preservation
- **Retry Phase**: Automated recovery from transient failures

## 7. Security and Compliance Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage via environment variables
- **Token Handling**: In-memory caching with automatic refresh
- **Permissions**: Least-privilege Graph API application permissions
- **Network Security**: HTTPS-only communications

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: API communications encrypted in transit
- **Access Control**: Teams permissions mirror Slack channel privacy
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA considerations for user data handling

### Security Controls
- **Input Validation**: JSON schema validation for configurations
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages
- **Code Security**: PowerShell strict mode, no dynamic code execution

## 8. Performance and Scalability Design

### Performance Characteristics
- **Throughput**: 1000+ messages/minute typical
- **Concurrency**: Parallel file processing and API batching
- **Memory Usage**: Streaming processing for large datasets
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect API limits
